      The Flood is an online publication that sits at the confluence of
      radical politics and rooted spirituality.
    </p>
    <p class="submissions-paragraph">
      Founded by a collective of young writers who met at the New York
      Catholic Worker, The Flood began as a conversation amid the daily tasks
      of running the NYCW houses of hospitality—serving soup, distributing
      clothing, and caring for the sick and elderly.
    </p>
    <p class="submissions-paragraph">
      As we expand this conversation, The Flood invites writers of all
      backgrounds to explore the religious implications of political realities
      and vice versa. We’re interested in spiritual life inside the prison
      industrial complex; Indigenous resistance to neoliberal development
      projects; rural US church groups witnessing against drone warfare;
      arguments for Universal Basic Income based on Qur’anic teaching, places
      of worship offering sanctuary to undocumented Immigrants; the personal
      realities and challenges of administering the biblical Works of Mercy;
      everyday life as a queer person of faith in the South; African American
      church congregations debating how to respond to police violence; Rabbis
      decrying occupation and militarism in The Holy Land; Tibetan Buddhists
      resisting colonialism; interfaith responses to the climate crisis;
      agnostic experiences of God; atheist spirituality; and language that
      breaks down the spiritual/secular binary. We’re interested in universal
      experiences of the vast and unknowable leading people to the most
      particular of convictions.

        Histories of spirituality and social movements are inseparable.
        Experiences of the sublime bump up against the mechanisms of the state,
        bureaucracy meets intimacy, and the mundane is disrupted by jubilation.
        The Flood explores this ongoing relationship and asks:
      <span class="thesis-question">
        as the waters rise, how can we help each other stay afloat?

      nor do we write from a specifically or uniquely Catholic point of view.
      Our influences and inspirations span a wide spectrum of spiritual and
      political traditions, including ecofeminism, anarchism, left Irish
      Republicanism, communal egalitarianism, Jewish and Islamic mysticism,
      Dharmic religions, animism, and a variety of Indigenous community
      structures and faiths.
